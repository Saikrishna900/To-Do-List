Project Name: To-Do List

Description: The To-Do List project is a simple and user-friendly application that allows users to manage and organize their daily tasks and priorities. The project was built using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages and can be accessed through a web browser.

Features:

    Add and Edit Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their list and edit existing ones as needed.

    Mark Completed Tasks: Users can mark their completed tasks, which will be highlighted in a different color.

    Prioritize Tasks: Users can prioritize their tasks by arranging them in order of importance or deadline.

    Filter Tasks: Users can filter their tasks by priority or completion status, making it easier to manage their to-do list.

    Local Storage: The application uses local storage to store the tasks, allowing users to close and reopen the application without losing their list.

Challenges Faced: One of the challenges faced during the project was implementing the local storage feature, as it required a good understanding of JavaScript's local storage API. However, this was overcome through research and experimentation.

Overall, the To-Do List project is a simple and effective solution for those looking to manage their daily tasks in a more organized manner.
